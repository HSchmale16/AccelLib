# AccelLib
A library to work with analog accelerometers on various single board
computers, specifically the linux based boards. It is designed to be as
cross-platform as possible. It is designed to have arduino like calls for
setting the GPIO pins (this project has no relation to the arduino project).

It also includes a nice namespace based library for accessing the GPIO pins on
certain boards such as single board computers.

# Currently Supported Platforms
* Raspberry Pi ( Still being Implemented )
