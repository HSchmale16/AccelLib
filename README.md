# AccelLib
A library designed to work with analog accelerometers on various development
boards. This library should provide an easy way to update the accelerometers
and compare them against previous values. It should hide almost all
implementation details from the user of the library. Additionally, this
library should be as cross-platform as possible for each development board.
However, this library is currently only supported on arduino.

#Arduino install notes
To build this project for arduino you need to run the 'make arduino' command
which creates a zip that you can import with the arduino ide.

# Currently Supported Platforms
